Now while integration with the Jenkins

->Jenkins ->ManagePlugins

Available -> Deploy to container plugin should be installed .


Now once it is installed we need to add the users with the roles of the developers that we have given for the TomcatInstallation.md

And then in post build action we need to give deploytocontainer adn their
we give **/*.war wild card adn then we basically addd the credentiasl of the deployer .





===================================

Github PollSCM concept

enable pollscm for the repository that exists under the build trigger options so that the changes in the code whenever are seen jenkins deploys to the browser .

Awesome !!!  Awesome !!! Awesome !!!
